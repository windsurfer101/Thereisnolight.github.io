Today i was stuck on an exercise but right before my ten minutes was up i completed the exercise then i found the next exercise much easier.

Today i found the exercises much easier after yesterday and i have made 3 %  improvement today

Today i completed another two exercises which were quite hard but with the previous bit of code that i have used it  became much easier my final result is 38%
