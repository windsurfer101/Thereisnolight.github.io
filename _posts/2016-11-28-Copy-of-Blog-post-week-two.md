    <td>i learnt by taking it one step at a time as i thought if i rushed it I would be stuck later on and wouldn't be able to perform to the best of my ability rather than ask for help as I would not have learnt anything  and would just be copying and i also feel that by using the arm more i was able to get more understanding of its capabilities and the code itself </td>

  <tr>
    <td>the main limit to my learning was the way i struggle with variables and the pixels for the final part the code was quite  easy to understand if you had focused on the previous tasks you can clearly understand the code is just easy parts but in a complex form that makes it look hard so i need to stop taking things by their first impression and work it out and on some parts of the code it was easier than using the arm as it was hard to get one part in the right place</td>

  <tr>
    <td>i will improve my learning by making everything as good as i can and do it as fast as i can which will help me in the long run as the faster i am the more easy the work seems so the foster only work for less work I have and I will be overall better then I will see if I hadn't been as fast and i will make sure that i stop the robot arm before it starts to click as that slows down the whole process of the work and will damage the robot arm </td>
