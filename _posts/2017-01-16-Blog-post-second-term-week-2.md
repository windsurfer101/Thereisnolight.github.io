    <td>i was using the instructions but that was not the only thing i did as i had a good idea of what some of the pieces of the code were so I would try and do it on my own then read the instructions and when i needed to corroborate my knowledge with the code i think it was quite easy</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>i think i gave up too easily and i need to make sure i have tried everything i can before using the hint as i think i relied on it too much when coding also i did not put my hand up to answer questions as i thought they would be wrong which meant i was not helping myself </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>i will probably need to make sure i am not afraid of being wrong and then that will allow me to be better at coding so i know what each bit of code does</td>
