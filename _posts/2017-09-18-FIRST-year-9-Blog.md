Today in IT we learnt how to fix certain sections for reference as opposed to it changing if you drag the vlookup. I think that what I could do more would be adding false at the end of the vlookup. 
=iferror(vlookup(L4,$A$1:$B$27,2,false),)
 this code means look at this (vlookup(L4) and using that print it in the cell and if there is nothing in thwe cell just do nothing (iferror(...),)
