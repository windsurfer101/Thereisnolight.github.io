    <td>we worked on our blog to make them better with their format and my blog was amazing so i got to teach others how to code their blog and i really learnt more by teaching others how to code and i also got onto the robot arm there was a difficulty with the code as we had grouped together 2 bits of code that were separate </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to think rationally and do as the book says as i put the 2 parts of the code together that were not meant to be together and with the robot arm i need to stop it before it gets to the point where it clicks</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will make my learning better by  making sure i have followed the book as it says to do something then i mutate that so i will just follow the book and take all that  i had from it and make sure it works</td>
