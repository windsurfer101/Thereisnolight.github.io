    <td>i found that reading the book and changing the code as i thought fit as i feel i can confidently say that with this coding i can code much better things to do more creative things later on if i learn a small bit more i feel it will greatly enhance my learning to be able to code more creatively would be an advantage as i could enhance my coding ten-fold</td>

  <tr>
    <td>i need to work on my typing as i miss some capital letters that slow me down as i have to go back and correct my spacing so if i speed up i feel i would shore off my main weakness and i will have to save my work more often as i had to redo my work multiple times  which stopped my work</td>

  <tr>
    <td>i need to change lots of things but the main things i need to work on are the parts wherew i can put all the small things that slow me down a lot such as typing and saving my work which i will have to work n but it wont be that hard</td>
