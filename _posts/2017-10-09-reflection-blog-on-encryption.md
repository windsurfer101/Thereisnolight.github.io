Over the past four weeks we have done lots of stuff using google sheets that I did not know how to do before. We started off in the first week talking about different encryptions, we started by having the letters moved on by 2 letters so A was CD, then we put a word at the beginning of the the alphabet and had that take up the letters. Finally we converted the letters to numbers and moved them on. Week 2 we learnt about how you can have the encryption table look at you typed alphabet and print in the box by looking at the letter next to it and then using the alphabet on the sheet it printed it in the box using the =iferror(vlookup(L4,$A$1:$B$27,2,false),) function. The iferror at the beginning just say is there is nothing in the box do nothing. Week 3 we learnt about what concatenate does or can do. The piece of code is =concatenate(M4:M51)which means take everything from M4:M51 and print it in one box.
