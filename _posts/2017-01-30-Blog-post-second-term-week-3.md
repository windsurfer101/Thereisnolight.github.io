    <td>I learnt by looking at the glossary at the same time i was coding as it made it much easier so i understood the code which made the hard code easier to work with and with python the main problem is everything has to be perfect and there is no way for it to be slightly wrong</td>

    <td>I feel that getting small things wrong was my main problem as codecademy doesn't accept slight problems even in strings which made it very hard for me to do it for me</td>

    <td>I will check all of the sections that are needed and i will make all of the sections  show all parts of the code that are necessary and i will learn how to correctly indent code as i put random indentations</td>
