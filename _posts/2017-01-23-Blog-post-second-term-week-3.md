    <td>i was using the instructions but that was not the only thing i did as i had a good idea of what some of the pieces of the code were so I would try and do it on my own then read the instructions and when i needed to corroborate my knowledge with the code i think it was quite easy i also found that doing a little bit every so often it made me feel better at doing it as it was easier to do it the more i did it</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>i think i gave up too easily and i need to make sure i have tried everything i can before using the hint as i think i relied on it too much when coding also i did not put my hand up to answer questions as i thought they would be wrong which meant i was not helping myself </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>i will probably need to make sure i am not afraid of being wrong and then that will allow me to be better at coding so i know what each bit of code does and another improvement would be to try and do more of the exercise before checking it so it is faster </td>
