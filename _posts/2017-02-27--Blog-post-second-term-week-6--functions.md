    <td>Using small pieces of code from previous exercises I changed them along with examples from the instructions and then with the code that I had changed if it had errors that I would not see instantly then I would edit small bits of code then when I had fixed it I would use the same technique</td>

    <td>I feel that I have relied on the examples too much and it is getting to the point where I am not learning the proper way the code works as it is not helping to speed my coding up either</td>
